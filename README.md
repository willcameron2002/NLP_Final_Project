# Analysis of NBA Twitter's (X's) Reactions to NBA Trades
By Will Cameron

## Abstract
On September 27, 2023, 7x NBA All-Star Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks. Predictably, NBA fans on Twitter were immediately spurred into a frenzy, filling the site with their opinions on the blockbuster trade. Now that the season has begun and there is a decent sample for Bucks games, the accuracy of their opinions can be assessed. Utilizing Selenium WebDriver, a Twitter scraper was created to collect relevant tweets posted shortly after the trade occurred. Training sets of tweet sentiment and tweet subject were created and used to train numerous candidate models. HuggingFace and Logistic Regression models emerged as the best performing for sentiment and subject respectively, allowing for classification of the full dataset of tweets. With each tweet classified with its sentiment and subject, analysis utilizing the NBA’s defensive rating, offensive rating, and net rating stats could be conducted. Using ratios of positive to negative tweets on each subject, predictions of each relevant stat for this year was calculated and compared to the real values. In general, Twitter users overestimated how good this trade was for the Milwaukee Bucks. However, each prediction was in the correct direction and simply off by magnitude, showing NBA fans on Twitter do have a fair amount of insight into the effects of NBA trades.

## Introduction
With the advent of social media, the average person can share their opinions to more people than ever before. Paired with the competitive and passionate nature of sports, social media circles discussing professional sports are often extremely reactionary, biased, and unfiltered with thousands of different perspectives chiming in. The NBA specifically has a younger and thus more active on social media fan base than other sports, leading to an even more vile discussion space on social media apps. The pinnacle of this phenomenon is NBA Twitter. Filled with genuine love and hatred for players, NBA Twitter is extremely polarized and reactionary with most people stating their opinions as fact.

With a wealth of opinions available, a “wisdom of the crowd” question emerges. If as a collective mind NBA Twitter could accurately assess parts of the game, a useful tool for scouts and general managers could emerge. The collective of people discussing a topic could do far more total research than a few people on a scouting team and potentially produce ideas not considered by teams. A scenario where this could shine would be for player trades as they can completely change the way a team or player plays and assessing trades is largely theory. If successful, analyzing Twitter sentiment could prove to be a uniquely valuable tool to teams as a way of evaluating their opponents after a trade.

## Literature Review
Currently, there is little research into the usefulness of NBA Twitter. Most of the research focuses on sports organizations and how they utilize Twitter to connect with fans. The amount of research using sentiment analysis with NBA Twitter is even smaller. Current research has focused on the NBA All-Star game voting (Su and Chen), a process done in-part by fans, or specific games (Baucom et al.) and game performances (Li, Qiwen, et al.). The research conducted in this project is unique in that it does not study anything fans interact with and is based more in theory as it is predicting NBA trades when there are no games to look at. This will allow for a more in depth look into the ability of NBA Twitter to think for itself rather than react to how players perform in specific games.

## Methodology/Dataset
Considering it was the trade that inspired this project, it seemed natural to focus on the recent Damian Lillard trade to the Milwaukee Bucks as a proof of concept. First, tweets were collected using the Selenium WebDriver. Utilizing Twitter’s advanced search, tweets related to Damian Lillard and the Milwaukee Bucks posted within a day of the trade were collected. However, using Selenium posed issues as Twitter will only load 90-100 tweets for each search, limiting the size of the final dataset and meaning multiple datasets and searches had to be combined to create the final dataset. All searches combined, the dataset reached nearly 1500 tweets. Upon creation of the dataset, 600 tweets were manually labeled with their sentiment (negative, neutral, positive) and their subject (defense, offense, both, neither) for training.

The HuggingFace transformer model twitter-roberta-base-sentiment was eventually used to classify the tweet’s sentiment. Attempts at neural networks fell victim to overfitting and the transformer outperformed Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers after being trained on the training data. Additionally, the transformer model was attractive as it had already been trained on millions of tweets and was generally familiar with the unique language of Twitter. For subject analysis, a Logistic Regression model was used as it had a surprisingly high accuracy and neural network attempts also overfit rapidly. 

To compare Twitter opinions to the actual performance of the team, the NBA’s defensive rating, offensive rating, and net rating were used. Defense rating is representative of the number of points a team allows per 100 possessions, meaning the lower, the better (“Stat Glossary”). Offensive rating is the number of points a team scores per 100 possessions, meaning the higher, the better. Net rating is the difference between these two.

## Results
Once all the tweets had been classified for sentiment and subject, graphs could be created to gain a greater understanding of how NBA Twitter reacted to the trade. **Figure 1** shows the tweets separated by sentiment. Following the initial massive announcement tweets, the opinions begin flowing in. Considering the size of the points denotes the number of likes and retweets, the positive tweets had more interaction across the board than negative tweets, possibly showing more people agreeing with these tweets. The tweets were classified at roughly 60% neutral, 30% positive, and 10% negative.
