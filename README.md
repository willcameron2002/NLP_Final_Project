By Will Cameron

## Abstract
On September 27, 2023, 7x NBA All-Star Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks. Utilizing Selenium WebDriver, a Twitter scraper was created to collect relevant tweets posted shortly after the trade occurred. Training sets of tweet sentiment and tweet subject were created and used to train numerous candidate models. HuggingFace and Logisitic Regression models emerged as the best performing for sentiment and subject respectively, allowing for classification of the full dataset of tweets.
