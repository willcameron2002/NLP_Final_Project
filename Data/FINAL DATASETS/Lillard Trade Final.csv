Bucks already got great defense and Lillard has been an elite player for years, he'll need to adapt to a new system where he's not the best player on the team but I think it's a huge improvement and he'll adapt. Imo they'll do great if nothing goes wrong (injuries).",0,0,10

Elite Hockey72,2023-09-27T18:36:42.000Z,obv the bucks getting lillard is a huge win for them but i mean losing jrue holiday and his defense is a big loss too and phoenix gave up ayton but still got back a shit ton so win-win-win of a trade for all teams,0,0,10
Unhinged,2023-09-27T18:28:58.000Z,"Bucks playoff defense will be very interesting with Lillard. They have no real guard stoppers right now, but ig in the east it won’t matter.",0,0,10
Tony Koch,2023-09-27T18:43:00.000Z,Does this make MIL better? I’m honestly not sure. Holliday was a great fit and is the best on ball defender in the league. Lillard plays limited defense. And Grayson Allen was a key guy on that Bucks team too. #WojBomb,1,2,13
šahin,2023-09-27T18:51:07.000Z,"I estimate Jrue highly, more than dame cuz he plays lock down defense lillard doesn't move the needle for me defensively but het again bucks already a good defensive team",0,0,10
Wimmer,2023-09-27T19:02:37.000Z,I don’t like that Damian Lillard trade for the Bucks. Jrue Holiday was a great fit there and had great team chemistry. Now they add an aging star who doesn’t want to be there or play any defense.,0,0,10
Nathan Riley,2023-09-27T23:42:59.000Z,Can't knock bucks for trying. But I don't know if Lillard is that much of an upgrade  . Liability on defense and injury prone. As for the Blazers they're move is looking good #Blazers #bucks #dame,0,0,10
My Name Is My Name,2023-09-27T19:55:52.000Z,Lillard can give you a 50 piece any given night. Bucks are definitely going to miss Holiday's defense though.,0,0,10
Jerron,2023-09-27T20:04:35.000Z,That Lillard trade is about to shake up the East. The Bucks were already a dope team though and Jrue is a dawg on defense as well. If all is well can't wait you see what happens,0,3,13
AUNTIE ASF,2023-09-27T19:48:29.000Z,"Now lets allow room for this “post-but clarity” of the Damien Lillard trade.

The Bucks DID indeed take a hit. A HUGE hit at that on defense.

Also…are we making Crowder dependable again?",0,1,11
Quinton Klabon,2023-09-27T19:06:50.000Z,"I prefer a 33-year-old plays immaculate defense to a 33-year-old who cannot play defense, especially when the person cleaning up the latter's messes is 35.

JRUE HOLIDAY FOREVER.

TJ,2023-09-27T19:55:22.000Z,It isn't even debatable. People love being contrarians. We saw the Bucks get eliminated in the first round while Jimmy Butler put Jrue to pasture while he stunk up the joint offensively and people want to say losing Jrue's defense trumps gaining Dame Lillard???,1,3,14
BK_Born_N_Raised,2023-09-27T21:46:34.000Z,"Holiday helped the Bucks win because of his defense. 

Lillard is better offensively and worst defensively.",0,1,11
Mrloon414,2023-09-27T20:22:13.000Z,"But why? 
We lost a lot of defense players for #DameTime. I understand Damian Lillard a big plus, but defense wins 's. 
Let's pray that this trade comes as a positive for the #Bucks.

Aiden Fuller,2023-09-27T20:44:42.000Z,"Bucks might of gotten better offensively, but with Middleton regressing physically and defensively and lack of defense lillard brings they have gotten considerably worse defensively.

Kellen Edwards,2023-09-27T19:40:43.000Z,"Yes, you have to get back to being an no holes defense now that bucks have lillard, you will not out gun that roster",0,1,11
RC99,2023-09-27T19:55:51.000Z,What are u talking about the bucks are the same team they lose Jrue and replace with Dame how are they better. Dame doesn’t play defense,0,4,14
Dave Euro,2023-09-27T19:31:02.000Z,Bucks will miss Holiday’s defense. Believe that. And can Lillard stay healthy?,1,0,11

Joseph Palmieri,2023-09-27T18:34:23.000Z,And bucks still have no defense lol jrue was there best defender and now lillard yes but his defense is abysmal.,0,2,12
Grant Smith,2023-09-27T18:32:31.000Z,The Bucks gave up Jrue?! I don’t care if you got Lillard they actually might have gotten worse because they have no defense now.,0,0,10
Aaron Williams,2023-09-27T18:59:36.000Z,I guess throw Yuta in there too. I don't see Lillard being a scary matchup problem for a team that now has 3 superstars that can score and distribute with a metric fuck ton of shooting around them. The Bucks sacrificing their perimeter defense for Lillard helps us out.,0,0,10
Blake Schofield,2023-09-27T20:41:37.000Z,We will see if the Bucks can get Lillard to show more effort and compete on defense. I'm curious to see if he can improve in this area while playing for a contender.,0,1,11

Gedi,2023-09-27T19:19:16.000Z,"Permitter defense is non-existent, but it’s good trade for the Bucks. I don’t think Lillard on Miami moves the needle, that team has no size.",1,0,11
John Lopez,2023-09-27T18:51:39.000Z,"I feel like trading holiday to get Lillard at this point in his career doesn’t really help the Bucks as much as people think. Holiday is one of the best defenders and also has a good offensive game. Dame is a offensive player only, you lose a lot on defense with this trade",0,2,12
Knowledge,2023-09-27T21:00:00.000Z,"@Bucks
 are worse now. All they needed was to add another player that could consistently make open 3's and play defense. Instead they traded their best perimeter defender (possibly the league) for Lillard who is a known defensive liability. Not an upgrade for this team.",0,0,10
