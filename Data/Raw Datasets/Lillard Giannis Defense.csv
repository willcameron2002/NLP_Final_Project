The bucks become so dangerous in the 2 man game. 

With Lillard being such a threat to score out of DHO & BS the defense is going to have to pick & choose.

1. Awesome haul for the Blazers!

2. Bucks losing Jrue’s defense is a huge gamble, but it makes sense

3. Lillard/Giannis is going to be so fun to watch

Joško,2023-09-27T23:43:57.000Z,I don’t think so. Okoro/Levert on Lillard and Mobley and Allen on Giannis. This season is going go entirely rely on the offense because we know the defense will produce. That being said I do think the Bucks win in a series vs us but not in 4,0,1

Ethan Ebert,2023-09-27T19:43:50.000Z,Gotta understand having Bigs and wings who can defend are much more important than a guard. Having Giannis and Brook will be plenty if defense for the major offensive upgrade of Lillard,0,9

couchgoatee,2023-09-27T20:31:37.000Z,Curious to see how Giannis holds up this season. My guess is he’ll need to play a lot more hard minutes this season. Jrue covered up a lot of holes up top and allowed Brook and Giannis to play reactive defense.,0,0
