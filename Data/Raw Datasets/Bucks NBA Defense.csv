Mark Michalski,2023-09-27T20:02:39.000Z,Damian Lillard a Milwaukee Buck.  I will miss Holiday's defense though.  He did wonderful things for the Milwaukee community and played a huge part in the Milwaukee Bucks winning the NBA Championship!  #FearTheDeer,0,1
delly,2023-09-27T21:20:58.000Z,#nba The Bucks just traded defense for offense..they wanna try & score with the Nuggets & have somebody more reliable to have the ball in his hands than Bagless&Holiday..well you got that now.. good luck trying out score the Nuggets,0,0

Unimpeachable Listmaker,2023-09-27T19:46:22.000Z,"This app man…

Damian Lillard just had one of the best offensive seasons a guard has ever had in NBA history.  The perimeter defensive stuff isn’t that big a deal because their back line defense is so elite.

The Bucks have to be the favorite to win the NBA title now.",0,11

Y’all this is potentially tail end of his prime Dame Lilliard with prime Giannis Antetokounmpo, bask in that",0,3
Jeremiah Martin,2023-09-27T18:54:28.000Z,"Picture this..

Dame offense, Jrue defense/offense at the 2,

Petros Sebhatu,2023-09-27T19:33:00.000Z,"Exactly. So much gravity at the rim & perimeter.

I see everybody with the perimeter D concerns & I understand it - but the Cavs had the best defense last yr w/ two small guys in the backcourt.

Because all that matters in the NBA is helpside/rim protection. Which the Bucks have.",1,1
Letting Go,2023-09-27T20:23:24.000Z,"Dame to the Bucks is a Game changer for them. Honestly it’s a perfect fit for Dame, because it’s one of maybe 2 teams in the NBA that can mitigate his lack of defense.

It will be interesting to watch Giannis & Middleton offball & how they work in that system. But Bucks are more…",3,38

JD Sportsnation #DEPRESSEDBRONCOSFAN,2023-09-27T19:31:37.000Z,"My thoughts on Dame trade

-Definitely a layup to ECF and on paper definitely the team to beat in entire NBA

-Bucks still needs perimeter depth for defense 

-Heat will most likely make up for Dame Miss with Jrue

-Suns got some depth somewhat,but going from Ayton to Nurkic is",0,1

praneel,2023-09-27T19:15:06.000Z,"first thoughts: 
bucks win by far, dame is an insane offensive player and gives them one of the most impossible to guard duos in NBA history. Losing jrue will hurt to an extent, but their backline defense is incredible so they can survive without jrue’s point of attack juice.",0,15

FireInMyBones,2023-09-27T18:57:58.000Z,"Milwaukee's run is over. Giannis will leave after realizing Dame is just another shot-jacking combo guard who doesn't play defense. I like Jrue and Ayton together in Portland under Coach Billups tutelage, especially if Jrue can stay healthy.
