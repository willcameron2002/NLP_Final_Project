GET #30 HELP,2023-09-27T22:27:12.000Z,"The Warriors present the biggest threat to the Milwaukee Bucks due to their lack of perimeter defense. Unlike other teams, like the Lakers, we do not rely on Biggs for our offense.",5,27
Zona,2023-09-27T18:58:41.000Z,"If Phoenix does end up meeting Milwaukee in a 2021 rematch... 

I for one, am thrilled that Jrue Holiday will not be wearing a Bucks uniform. 

As terrifying as the Dame-Giannis duo is, Phoenix's offense can keep up.",22,513
NYKnicksPodcast,2023-09-27T19:06:55.000Z,Dame is not the upgrade that Milwaukee thinks he is. Great on offense but D is plain bad. Bucks are going to miss Jrue,1,3
Nenad Stefanović,2023-09-27T19:52:56.000Z,"Milwaukee Bucks switched defense for offense! 

Interesting  ...",0,2
Siddharth,2023-09-27T18:57:10.000Z,"Milwaukee Bucks half court offense got no excuses now. Absolute home-run of a deal for them, to turn Jrue on an expiring into freakin' 4 years of Dame Lillard coming off his career-best season. And they only had to include 1 unprotected 1st & 2 unprotected pick-swaps",0,1
Justin W.,2023-09-27T21:16:37.000Z,"Damian Lillard to help the Bucks crunch time half court offense is soooo much better than anything anyone could have materially hoped for for Milwaukee. 

The difference between Jrue and Damian Lillard offensively is Grand Canyon sized and that's being kind.",3,47
Ethan Ward,2023-09-27T19:31:56.000Z,"While sending Jrue packing is bittersweet, look no further than the Bucks' putrid offense down the stretch against Miami.

Dame's level of guile and decisiveness makes him the perfect offensive linchpin to ensure Milwaukee's sets never get bogged down in the same manner.",0,1
Xavier Zamarron,2023-09-27T21:39:38.000Z,"Milwaukee’s biggest weakness lied in their half-court offense which #Dame will help with A LOT, but their team’s identity was defense first. There’ll definitely be some growing pains but they are better than they were yesterday  #Bucks #Blazers #NBA",0,0
Cyrus Rogers,2023-09-27T19:09:17.000Z,"#Dame to the #Bucks is box office with #Giannis. This swings the East towards Milwaukee. They lose defence, but gain major offense. Do they walk the East? I'm not sure, but they have more firepower. Let's not forget how well the Suns & Blazers have done too.",0,2
KingofDeath,2023-09-27T18:29:28.000Z,"I don't know how to feel about Milwaukee acquiring Damian Lillard. A part of me loves the offense. However, defensively, I'm apprehensive (especially considering that the Bucks had to give up Jrue, who wanted to finish his career with the Bucks).",0,0
josh,2023-09-27T18:28:34.000Z,"Suns got their depth, bucks gonna have the best offense in the league. Blazers got good stars and picks. Honestly one of the best trades I’ve seen for all three teams. The question now is, dame said he’s only okay for Miami, but I think he’ll be content in Milwaukee.",0,0
Timmy Buckets,2023-09-27T19:32:47.000Z,"I think in Milwaukee he will do better on defense because he won’t have as big of an onus on offense as he did in Portland. Jrue is still way better on D, but it still makes the bucks a better team than before this trade.",0,0
Albert,2023-09-27T19:05:48.000Z,People don’t get that Jrue’s been mediocre on defense and absolutely abysmal on offense innrhe playoffs since he’s gotten to Milwaukee. The upgrade that same offers them can’t be overstated enough. People that haven’t actually watched the bucks will have a rough awakening,0,1
bubatfuba,2023-09-27T19:42:54.000Z,"Tony, you told me(is) that this Giannis stuff was a good thing because it meant a chance that Milwaukee gets worse..... 

WELL???? 

It looks like it inspired them to get better......... 

I am curious how the Bucks look this year after a month or two. Will the offense prevail?",0,2
Anthony Riccobono,2023-09-27T18:50:53.000Z,The Bucks lost in the first round last season because they shit their pants on offense late in games. Dame is one of the NBA’s most deadly assassins in crunch time. GREAT trade for Milwaukee.,0,0
Brett Richey,2023-09-27T20:47:11.000Z,"Yes & his strength (offense) is more meaningful to a Bucks team than Jrue’s defense, Milwaukee has some pretty good defenders remaining. 

I think",0,2
