Jim Park,2023-09-27T18:21:46.000Z,Did the Bucks get better by swapping Holiday for Lillard? Tough one. The offense obviously improves vastly but defense falls off the map at PG.,14,129
KJ,2023-09-27T18:32:15.000Z,Jrue a great guy forever grateful but this is  Dame Lillard. Stotts and Dame reunion no excuses anymore for Bucks halfcourt offense. Bucks are on a two year window. Speechless. Excited!,0,8
Daniel Lopez,2023-09-27T20:04:52.000Z,Portland received alot of good pieces for Lillard. Bucks essentially gave up defense for offense at the Guard position.,0,0
Justin W.,2023-09-27T21:16:37.000Z,"Damian Lillard to help the Bucks crunch time half court offense is soooo much better than anything anyone could have materially hoped for for Milwaukee.

Grzegorz,2023-09-27T19:55:59.000Z,"This team looks fantastic. The #Bucks' defense will still be excellent despite losing Jrue, and the addition of #Lillard will make the offense much better. The Bucks are extremely well-balanced.
The duo of Giannis and #Dame is something that will be unstoppable ",0,0
Andy,2023-09-27T18:54:44.000Z,"Wow, that’s a move alright…

Bucks lose Jrue in the process, so their defense will take a hit. But Lillard’s offense and shooting will be a huge boost for the Bucks, so maybe it’s a net positive?

Mr. Perfect,2023-09-27T19:15:13.000Z,For the ppl saying the bucks got worse. Jrue kind of sucked on offense. Lillard and Giannis will make life much easier for each other.,0,0
Greg Hrinya,2023-09-27T19:27:49.000Z,"That's an incredible trade for the Bucks. To bring Lillard's offense to a team with Giannis, Middleton, Lopez, Portis is quite a steal. Plenty of D to cover up for Dame, and his offense should put them on another level. Big day for the Bucks.",0,2
Nate Deming,2023-09-27T18:28:07.000Z,"This makes the Bucks offense pretty nice but they lost a major piece on defense in Jrue Holiday. Lillard is nowhere close to the defender that Holiday is. Not sure this will make them more of a contender in the bigger picture.

Eric,2023-09-27T19:39:18.000Z,"I feel like this Bucks trade for Lillard automatically has Giannis resigning. He wanted improvement and this is an improvement. Sure Jrue plays defense better no doubt, but I think the offense Dame gives outweighs that with this team.",0,0

Harry Ballsagna,2023-09-27T19:12:11.000Z,"Lillard obviously makes them better. I would argue the Celtics offense is still way better than the Bucks offense. The Bucks have a good interior defense.

Joško,2023-09-27T23:43:57.000Z,I don’t think so. Okoro/Levert on Lillard and Mobley and Allen on Giannis. This season is going go entirely rely on the offense because we know the defense will produce. That being said I do think the Bucks win in a series vs us but not in 4,0,1
PBBBFlagship - the Great One,2023-09-27T19:16:21.000Z,"Also underrated is having a true PG for Giannis. The Bucks are not going to be chucking up early threes with Dame running things.
