"If they can get themselves a solid 2gaurd, this starting lineup is arguably the best in the league. 

Preferably a 3/d kinda guy, someone who can score off of the plays Dame/Giannis make and can help make up for Dame’s defense",1,1
Better question is who gonna play defense,1,1
Dame ain gotta play defense lol Giannis will and Giannis doesn’t have to shoot dame can shoot enough for the team,1,3

The duo of Giannis and #Dame is something that will be unstoppable ",2,2
"No.
Love Jrue, one of my favorite players.
Cannot over look how bad his offense has been on the playoffs though. His defense was amazing, yes, but Dame makes the bucks offense nigh unstoppable and they still have a top 10 defense at the VERY worst",2,3
what makes you think every single one of these teams fanbases are less worried about the dame/giannis pair than miami not getting dame? stupid ass thought process,1,0
"""As good a defender as Holiday is, when you can turn that into Lillard's offense and give them the 3-point shooting they need on nights when Middleton isn't delivering... They have everything they need.""

- The best odds to win the NBA Finals: +360",2,0
Heat scored 120 ppg vs the bucks in the playoffs without Herro and the bucks just got a whole lot worse on defense.,0,1
Only one fan base should be talking smack after the Dame trade. The Bucks. That’s it. They won.,1,0
Jrue was always playing defense. Who will play defense now ?,1,1
defense wins championships. Every single championship team has a great defense. The bucks just don’t seem like a good point of attack Defense team. Teams with pull up 3 point shooters will do heavy damage against the bucks,0,1

"Sports fans are weird.

If the Bucks didn't make the Dame trade because they didn't want to lose Jrue's defense, everyone would be losing their mind about how Dame's offense is worth it and how Giannis is going to leave.

Instead they did it and people are crying about defense.",1,3

Gotta understand having Bigs and wings who can defend are much more important than a guard. Having Giannis and Brook will be plenty if defense for the major offensive upgrade of Lillard,2,3

I can’t say this is a good move or bad move…Jrue Holiday played well on offense and defense and helped Bucks win a chip. We know Dame brings the offense at an elite level.  Dame and Giannis got to win a chip together…,1,3

Suns getting bodied by the Bucks like it’s 2021 again. Y’all all offense no defense. We got both,2,3
This a win-win for all teams Involved.Milwuakee gets a star point guard in Damian lillard and also it can also lead to Giannis committing to a contract Extension.Portland goes with youth movement.Then Suns gets more depth pieces and a center that can hopefully improve defense.,1,0
Dame with Giannis is dope but they lose such good defense and leadership from Holiday that Dame won’t be able to replace whatsoever.,1,1
"Now, with Dame being able to run the offense in the clutch, it’s going to be VERY difficult to stop the Bucks. Between Dame’s three ball, Middleton’s midrange, and Giannis’ scoring down low, the Bucks are going to wreak havoc in all three levels.",2,2
Bucks defense slipped when Brook or Giannis is out. Their primary defensive characteristic is Brook and Giannis being the backline defenders.,1,1
Big personal win in the Dame trade is Grayson Allen getting the fuck out of Milwaukee which allows me to like the Bucks unconditionally.,1,0
"I really like Jrue, but the Bucks offense could get really stagnant down the stretch of games in playoffs. 

And Jrue couldn’t stop Jimmy single handily this playoffs either, or even slow him down tbh.
