Mark Michalski,2023-09-27T20:02:39.000Z,Damian Lillard a Milwaukee Buck.  I will miss Holiday's defense though.  He did wonderful things for the Milwaukee community and played a huge part in the Milwaukee Bucks winning the NBA Championship!  #FearTheDeer,0,1

YvngBull,2023-09-27T18:39:38.000Z,Milwaukee definitely improved offensively but Dame gon have to start playing some defense. Jrue big key to Bucks success past 2-3 years,0,0
Flu Hefner,2023-09-27T19:32:23.000Z,Aye Malika talking bout Bucks having to fill all the holes on defense.  They basically swapped Dame for Jrue.  What defensive holes??  Portland took 1 player and a pick from Milwaukee,0,1
I Just Wanna Hoop,2023-09-27T18:40:10.000Z,"1.) Dame to Milwaukee is crazy and I swear I had no idea they were in the race for him.
2.) Trading DEFENSE for more scoring could be a good/bad thing for Milwaukee.
3.) PHOENIX IS REALLY GOOD. LIKE REALLY GOOD.

Doran,2023-09-27T18:23:13.000Z,"Can’t say I love Dame on the Bucks, heavily overlapping skill set with Khris and Milwaukee have lost roster flexibility with the picks lost. Lillard won’t be helping the defense much which has in my opinion been the key to Milwaukee’s success",0,0
Sparky Slanderson,2023-09-27T18:22:51.000Z,Bucks will miss Jrue Holiday and what he brings to the game especially on defense but Antetokounmpo said he wanted Milwaukee to remain competitive well you just got your wish. Not gonna be surprised if the Blazers move Jrue to another team later in the season. As 4 Miami FUCK’EM,0,0
nets basketball enjoyer,2023-09-27T18:37:01.000Z,"lots to think about dame in milwaukee but immediate thoughts are:

- bucks should be east favorites based on talent
- defense could now become an issue without jrue
- how does a rookie head coach handle this situation",0,0
Bryce Mcmillen,2023-09-27T19:22:05.000Z,Looking at the trade I think the bucks made the right call. If dame is happy in Milwaukee they have him next year and maybe an extension too if they preform well. Jrue and dame are both 33. I think his shooting will do better with the aging team better than Jrues defense,1,2
JHillsman,2023-09-27T18:54:14.000Z,"The offensive options the Milwaukee Bucks will have this upcoming season will be limitless. Sheesh! Wow, this slick, almost trying to give me '08 Celtics vibes - in terms of you knownits going to fit and work well together (yet defense is not as strong).",0,1

inamikgreg,2023-09-27T20:11:39.000Z,"Dame to #Bucks changes little if you're the #Celtics. Boston still has size to deal with Giannis. Milwaukee still lacks perimeter defense (and just lost Jrue Holiday). Yes, offensively Dame is going to be a problem, but not enough to swing the advantage in Bucks' favor",0,0

Xavier Zamarron,2023-09-27T21:39:38.000Z,"Milwaukee’s biggest weakness lied in their half-court offense which #Dame will help with A LOT, but their team’s identity was defense first. There’ll definitely be some growing pains but they are better than they were yesterday  #Bucks #Blazers #NBA",0,0
Albert,2023-09-27T21:23:39.000Z,Bingo. Lakers are the only team outside of the bucks to get a title with the duo that they have. Without Jrue the defense on Milwaukee is gonna well mediocre. Haha,0,1

Big Dog B,2023-09-27T19:09:14.000Z,The Bucks not having to give up Middleton or Lopez for a Lillard level player is crazy. Milwaukee wom this trade hands down. They lost defense with Jrue and Allen but still a win for the Bucks.,0,0
FireInMyBones,2023-09-27T18:57:58.000Z,"Milwaukee's run is over. Giannis will leave after realizing Dame is just another shot-jacking combo guard who doesn't play defense. I like Jrue and Ayton together in Portland under Coach Billups tutelage, especially if Jrue can stay healthy.

Timmy Buckets,2023-09-27T19:32:47.000Z,"I think in Milwaukee he will do better on defense because he won’t have as big of an onus on offense as he did in Portland. Jrue is still way better on D, but it still makes the bucks a better team than before this trade.",0,0

LaMarvelous8,2023-09-27T22:21:28.000Z,Milwaukee had 4 first team all nba players 3 first team on defense players and the best record in the nba last year and just added Dame dont be stupidly Bias Bucks are better,0,0

richierich,2023-09-27T21:58:03.000Z,Ehh the bucks really aren’t that stacked after giving up Grayson and Jrue in the trade. They lack defense now plus the heat made finals 2 of last 3 years and just last year we beat Milwaukee to get to the finals. Chances were pretty even I think. Just a big let down for Miami :/,0,1
Netsfan24,2023-09-27T18:44:50.000Z,Bucks gonna lose a key piece on defense trading Jrue but overall I think this was the right move for Milwaukee getting Giannis a star guard,0,0
Albert,2023-09-27T19:05:48.000Z,People don’t get that Jrue’s been mediocre on defense and absolutely abysmal on offense innrhe playoffs since he’s gotten to Milwaukee. The upgrade that same offers them can’t be overstated enough. People that haven’t actually watched the bucks will have a rough awakening,0,1
Inam Mahsah,2023-09-27T18:42:33.000Z,Bucks will have to figure out how Dame fits defensively caus he is not really known for his defense.  Heat pride themselves in defense.  We have faced Boston who is younger and faster.  Milwaukee is just an older version of Boston.  We got Spo as coach we will be fine.,0,1

CZAR.,2023-09-27T19:21:32.000Z,"Even tho I’m not sold, I think Dame could get a ring with Milwaukee easier than if he was with Miami. 

Bucks have a top 5 defense, size, and play makers on both sides of the ball. Dame would literally only put them over the hump offensively

Brett Richey,2023-09-27T20:47:11.000Z,"Yes & his strength (offense) is more meaningful to a Bucks team than Jrue’s defense, Milwaukee has some pretty good defenders remaining.

Krishna Narsu,2023-09-27T23:26:58.000Z,"In 2022, when they played, Milwaukee shot 27.9% from 3. No matter what level of defense you think Boston played, they got lucky with the Bucks hitting that low of a % from 3. So luck adjust and that series is probably a lot closer point differential wise.",0,0
Krishna Narsu,2023-09-27T22:32:23.000Z,"Tbh, I just don't see why any of those games mean anything to next year when both teams have changed significantly. Milwaukee changed head coaches too so their scheme might look different. BOS is also fully committing to a drop defense while the Bucks added a drop beating player.",0,0
