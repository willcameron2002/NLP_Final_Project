delly,2023-09-27T21:20:58.000Z,#nba The Bucks just traded defense for offense..they wanna try & score with the Nuggets & have somebody more reliable to have the ball in his hands than Bagless&Holiday..well you got that now.. good luck trying out score the Nuggets,0,0
dfuzecr,2023-09-27T18:30:13.000Z,"Overall 

Bucks defense got a lot worse and their offense might the the best in the nba",0,0
NWOT-LIM.. (15-7),2023-09-27T06:46:56.000Z,"Gotta admit not sure how Bucks stole that  w/ a dumb coach and playing in a head scratching and  predictable offense and defense. Heck if I still played I'd own Mike Buds Bucks too.. Lefraud no game

 was running the same play that Bud guy had zero clue how to stop..",0,0
Jason Scheff,2023-09-27T20:52:25.000Z,"The Takeaways: Dame an ideal fit with Giannis. Best big 3 in NBA. Significantly addresses the offensive struggles the Bucks have had during the playoffs. Their offense will be electric. 

The Questions: who are the impact players on the 2nd unit? Who’s defending on the perimeter?",0,0
Colby Wright,2023-09-27T19:06:55.000Z,Dame going to Bucks instead of the Miami Heat is a criminal offense by the NBA.,0,0
Mitchell Maurer,2023-09-27T19:41:16.000Z,"lmao the Bucks now have *Khris Middleton* as their third option on offense.

Khris Middleton!",3,41
Xavier Zamarron,2023-09-27T21:39:38.000Z,"Milwaukee’s biggest weakness lied in their half-court offense which #Dame will help with A LOT, but their team’s identity was defense first. There’ll definitely be some growing pains but they are better than they were yesterday  #Bucks #Blazers #NBA",0,0
John Michael,2023-09-27T18:55:27.000Z,"Cap, Bucks need something else to their offense then Giannis euros every play. I can already see it, Giannis PnR and if defender sags off Giannis, dame hitting pull up every time, if defender plays tight, roll is there everyday.",0,1
BIG LIBRA ENERGY,2023-09-27T19:09:46.000Z,Its based on the player. Giannis is reallllly good. There is no guard in the nba that fit giannis more than Curry but Dame is definitely a great second choice. The bucks offense was mainly carried by giannis and thats not sustainable. They need a go to scorer not named giannis,0,0
268 Sports,2023-09-27T18:32:23.000Z,"Damian Lillard last year:
32.2/4.8/7.3
4.2 made 3s per game on 37.1%.
8.3 Offensive BPM, 2nd in the NBA.

Lillard made the most pull-up 3s in the league last year. Offers huge potential for an offense that’s been stagnant at the end of games for years. The Bucks go all-in at…",0,0
Jeremiah Martin,2023-09-27T18:54:28.000Z,"Picture this..

Dame offense, Jrue defense/offense at the 2,

Then you have Giannis plus the bench they have, bucks will be a issue especially on defense this season.

classhandicapper,2023-09-27T21:20:41.000Z,I already know that Dame is one of the best offensive players in the NBA and the Bucks will be better on offense.  What you underrating is that Holiday is solid on offense overall and one of the best defensive players in the NBA. Dame is a negative defender.,0,0
Shane Young,2023-09-27T18:51:58.000Z,"Damian Lillard is the NBA's all-time leader in 3's made and attempted from 30+ feet.

That's going to be monumental for the Bucks' offense, which I expect to creep back into the Top 5 in halfcourt efficiency.",2,13
Bullit199,2023-09-27T19:10:17.000Z,Bucks got better offensively but worse defensively. But the NBA is trending toward offense so I guess we’ll see.,0,0
SecretMarquette,2023-09-27T19:02:43.000Z,"It is every game, both regular season and playoffs. It's probably my favorite source for stat nerdy NBA stuff. 

Dame is clearly a better overall fit because the bucks need offense instead of defense. 

It is still close to equal than it seems.",0,0
Anthony Riccobono,2023-09-27T18:50:53.000Z,The Bucks lost in the first round last season because they shit their pants on offense late in games. Dame is one of the NBA’s most deadly assassins in crunch time. GREAT trade for Milwaukee.,0,0
