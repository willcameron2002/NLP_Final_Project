No more worrying about who the closer is. 

No more lack of off-dribble scoring.

ITS DAMIAN FREAKING LILLARD LAUNCHING 30 FOOTERS AND RUNNING PICK AND ROLL WITH GIANNIS",94,2.1K
Mr. Perfect,2023-09-27T19:15:13.000Z,For the ppl saying the bucks got worse. Jrue kind of sucked on offense. Lillard and Giannis will make life much easier for each other.,0,0
Greg Hrinya,2023-09-27T19:27:49.000Z,"That's an incredible trade for the Bucks. To bring Lillard's offense to a team with Giannis, Middleton, Lopez, Portis is quite a steal. Plenty of D to cover up for Dame, and his offense should put them on another level. Big day for the Bucks.",0,2
Grzegorz,2023-09-27T19:55:59.000Z,"This team looks fantastic. The #Bucks' defense will still be excellent despite losing Jrue, and the addition of #Lillard will make the offense much better. The Bucks are extremely well-balanced.
The duo of Giannis and #Dame is something that will be unstoppable ",0,0
Ben Sigwart,2023-09-27T20:34:41.000Z,"Terry Stotts with Damian Lillard AND Giannis is going to be awesome. I’ve said that already but thought it should be mentioned again.

He made that Portland offense work well with two combo guards as the features.

Imagine what he can create with Dame paired with Giannis!",0,1
Dave Algonquin,2023-09-27T18:35:42.000Z,"Milwaukee: huge upgrade on offense, downgrade on defense, the Lillard/Giannis PnR is gonna be insane 
Portland: gets Ayton, rights to MIL picks when Giannis will be old, and can flip Jrue for more assets
Phoenix: just needs guys who can dribble because the roster is so top-heavy",0,1
Casey,2023-09-27T18:42:09.000Z,"The bucks are gonna put out a lineup of
DAMIAN LILLARD
Khris Middleton
Pat Connaughton 
GIANNIS I’m not spelling that name
Brook Lopez

The defense is not going to be a problem at all for them. Oh and this may be the best offense of all time that hasn’t come from a GSW team.",0,0
Trade Middleton ASAP,2023-09-27T22:26:45.000Z,Can we please trade Middleton now!!!  If I have to watch him try to run the offense with Lillard and Giannis here I’ll rip my hair out.,0,1
Val,2023-09-27T19:16:36.000Z,"Lillard (meilleur coéquipier en carrière = CJ McCollum, no offense mais voilà) qui va découvrir les espaces que peut créer Giannis :",2,11
Tyler,2023-09-27T18:21:51.000Z,"If all the teams Lillard could’ve gone to, I’m ok with the Bucks honestly. Better upside on offense for them but big loss on defense. Interesting to see how this plays out but initially I’m excited to see Dame and Giannis play together",0,0
Eric,2023-09-27T19:39:18.000Z,"I feel like this Bucks trade for Lillard automatically has Giannis resigning. He wanted improvement and this is an improvement. Sure Jrue plays defense better no doubt, but I think the offense Dame gives outweighs that with this team.",0,0
THE SIXTH MAN,2023-09-27T18:46:26.000Z,"Damian lillard to the bucks

Now Giannis has a legit superstar by his side who can also give you 30 a night

But more importantly he fixing the bucks offense issue down the stretch and in the half court because he’s one of the best shooters and scorers ever at point guard",0,0
Reece Reese,2023-09-27T19:02:35.000Z,You gonna need that offense in the playoffs which Jrue didn’t provide anymore. Losing Jrue defense is rough but Gaining Lillard offense with Giannis is huge. Allen is a decent defender but they won’t miss him that much imo,0,0
PBBBFlagship - the Great One,2023-09-27T19:16:21.000Z,"Also underrated is having a true PG for Giannis. The Bucks are not going to be chucking up early threes with Dame running things. 
@Dame_Lillard
 will do as much for 
@Giannis_An34
 as Giannis will for him. He’ll unlock true half-court offense for this team in the playoffs.",0,2
Harry Ballsagna,2023-09-27T22:58:06.000Z,"Bottom half of the league? In what metric. Also, the year before that, they were in the top 5. Again, stop pretending their offense can get that much better. Giannis is a ball dominant PF. Lillard is a ball dominant PG. It might not mesh as well as you assume.",0,0
Joško,2023-09-27T23:43:57.000Z,I don’t think so. Okoro/Levert on Lillard and Mobley and Allen on Giannis. This season is going go entirely rely on the offense because we know the defense will produce. That being said I do think the Bucks win in a series vs us but not in 4,0,1
Beyond the RK,2023-09-27T19:20:11.000Z,"Giannis with snipers Lillard and Middleton and Brolo's drop defense? scary

Ayton's midrange scoring off Scoot's and Sharpe's rim-pressure is a talented offense, with defense tbd if Jrue is flipped for firsts/prospects

Suns offload Ayton for Nurkic and wings to a short rotation",0,4
Brandon,2023-09-27T20:15:56.000Z,"I think they're banking on Middleton being healthy again and getting back to his 3&D days. plus, Giannis can hide a lot of Lillard's defensive deficiencies. Jrue is the more well-rounded player for sure but Dame's offense is leaps and bounds above Jrue's.",0,1
The Beautiful Struggle,2023-09-27T18:46:12.000Z,"Bucks defense will suffer but their offense will be more diverse with lillard know. Know with Lillard, Giannis can play his game a lot more as it opens up the dimension he relies on heavily. This will be interesting to see. Think Bucks mos def have a shot to be in ECF imo with mo",0,1
FT.,2023-09-27T18:39:36.000Z,"He wouldn’t make an open shot for you. Offense stagnates with it. The only player who can complement Giannis much more than Lillard is Steph. On paper, the Bucks will be devastating from the interior and with Lillard, it should be great from the perimeter.",1,0
DooM SkrubKiLLa,2023-09-27T18:35:09.000Z,"Milwaukee loses Holiday who was arguably their best on-ball guard defender...We'll see how Lillard and Giannis fit together since Giannis usually has the ball in his hands on offense, somebody will have to play off-ball...Phoenix desperately added more depth, but who gets cut",0,1
RBA,2023-09-27T20:26:39.000Z,"We'll see.

Giannis & Jrue had a great run together. I'm not going to assume they can make up w/offense what they're losing w/defense in the backcourt, esp factoring in Lillard's age.

This isn't an automatic homerun. J/S",0,1
Al Goodman(CoachGoody421),2023-09-27T19:35:18.000Z,"I want offense over defense if it's a jump from jrue to dame.

Lillard never had a Giannis.",0,1
Nick Suarez,2023-09-27T18:30:38.000Z,Yeah but they had pressure to keep Giannis with all the rumblings going on so I assume thats one of the motivating factors and also it is Dame lillard lol. But while that is a hell of an offense its not a superteam id want to see how their D shapes out. Helps when you got Giannis,0,1
HOOPS EMPIRE,2023-09-27T18:43:24.000Z,"A lot of people saying “defense” as if it wasn’t Jrues horrific offense that lost them 2022. It was like historic inefficiency. They just replaced Jrue holiday with Damian lillard and still have Giannis, Middleton and Brook. They got better. A lot better.",1,15
Charles Simon,2023-09-27T20:07:27.000Z,Holiday is a great defender but the team and Giannis (the biggest star in the Eastern Conference) needed help on offense. They have 2 guys that have been All-NBA on defense. Lillard makes a far bigger impact in the game than Holiday does. Plus thier chief rival just traded their…,0,0
